##Usage

npm install
npm start

The application will be served on http://localhost:3000/

##Notes

Initially, I chose Ember as that was what I was most comfortable with. As I worked on the application, I realied that Ember was a bit too heavy and had less data table libraries that were easy to use.

Even though I hadn't used React in a while, I ended up switching to React as it was lightweight and had many well documented libraries available. I used react-bootstrap-table for the data tables as it had features that were useful for this application.

##Future Versions
I would add more comments and incorporate tests if I wasn't spare on time. I would also have breaken it down into smaller components. I would also have liked to implement the edit feature which I could reuse the add record modal.

Ps. There is sorting on the columns even though the sorting icon is missing.
